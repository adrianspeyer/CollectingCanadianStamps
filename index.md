## So you just inherited some stamps, now what?

We are a group of friendly philatelists here to share our love and interest in stamps. This is not a group for trading and selling. Nor is this a group to ask for price checks or how to sell you stamps. Nonetheless, the question of what to do when you inherit a bunch of stamps or a stamp collection has come up enough to make this a document worth creating.

So what can you do when you suddenly find yourself with a stamp collection?

The most important thing to realize is that you are probably not going to be able to retire on that stamp collection. People collect stamps out of passion, and very rarely (or ever) collect to become rich. Just because stamps are old does not mean they have value. Nor are stamps that are in bad condition worth much either (especially stamps of the last 60+ years).

If a stamp is rare it usually comes with paperwork, or will be in a safe. You may even know how much was paid for it, because of some kind of receipt or notation.

Now that we’ve covered that, what can you do. Here are concrete ways to learn value:

* Head to a library and ask if they have a Scott’s catalog for the country of interest or Unitrade ( who specializes for Canada)

* Contact reputable dealers, you can find them [here](https://www.csdaonline.com/).

* Research on eBay at what the stamp has sold for, not what is asked.

* Head to a stamp show, you can find a list at [CSN](https://canadianstampnews.com/events/).

* Contact a local stamp club [here](https://canadianstampnews.com/collecting/stamp-clubs/).

We recommend you do some self research first before you sell. This is the best way to protect yourself. You can also use this helpful visual search to help you get started, available [here](http://www.collectionscanada.ca/archivianet/020117/020117030432_e.html) from Collections Canada.

We hope all of this info helps you get started in the right direction.
